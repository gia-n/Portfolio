    <p1 style = "text-align: start;"> My name is Gia Nichoson. I am a highschool student at Palo Alto High School <abbr> 
      Paly </abbr> (class of 2019). I am involved in the school theater tech program, where I mostly do costume design and production. 
      Outside of school, I spend most of my time either dancing or reading.
